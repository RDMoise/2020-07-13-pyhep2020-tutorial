## Uproot and Awkward Arrays

Tutorial PyHEP 2020, presented on July 13, 2020 at 15:10 CET, 06:10 PDT, 18:40 IST, 22:10 JST by [Jim Pivarski](mailto:pivarski@princeton.edu).

See [the agenda](https://indico.cern.ch/event/882824/timetable).

## How to participate

The preferred way to participate is to run the JupyterLab code with me, evaluating the code as we go and trying your own modifications.

You can run it on a public cloud service called Binder:

If you instead want to run everything on your own laptop, use pip to install the packages listed in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) and open [tutorial.ipynb](tutorial.ipynb) in Jupyter.

The [tutorial-EVALUATED.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jpivarski/2020-07-13-pyhep2020-tutorial/blob/1.1/tutorial-EVALUATED.ipynb) copy has all cells evaluated, in case you want to read it offline.
